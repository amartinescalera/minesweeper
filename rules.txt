The Rules for MinesWeeper:
	* We have two actors: board and square.
	* If we open a square with a mine, the game will be finished.
	* If we open a square without a mine but with a mine in the neighbour, the number of mines in the neighbour will be indicated.
	* If we open a square without a mine and there isn't mines in the neighbour, the neighboor square will be open.
